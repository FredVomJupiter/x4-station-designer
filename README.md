# x4-station-designer

The X-series is my favorite scifi space game series. Created by the small developer team "Egosoft" in WÃ¼rselen. Building space stations with the module sandbox is the most fun. It requires a lot of planning though if you want to get your stations up and running efficiently.

You can add modules, view input-output of single modules, get summaries of one module class and a complete station overview with highlighted deficit and surplus. This allows you to calculate, how many modules of each class you need to build a self-sufficient station.
