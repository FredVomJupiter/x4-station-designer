# x4-station-designer

The X-series is my favorite scifi-space game series. Created by the small developer team "Egosoft" in WÃ¼rselen it offers 4X:

1 Think, 2 Trade, 3 Fight and 4 Build.

Building spaces tations with the module sandbox is the most fun. It requires a lot of planning though if you want to get your
stations up and running efficiently. Although a really good station calculator already exists (http://www.x4-game.com/#/station-calculator
or https://github.com/crissian/x4 by Crissian), I decided to create a new and competitive version with a simpler UI, a clean code base
and some different features.

This is work in progress...
